# Cat vs Dog Classification

<hr>
This repository is a simple Convolutional Neural Network Model, used to classify images of dogs and cats as part of my deep learning exploratory studies.

The dataset used for this so called project is __[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog)__.

Any suggestion for improvement is highly welcome!
